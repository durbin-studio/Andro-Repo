This is the lite version of Android Repo. The full version uses JDBC to Connect with SQL server.
As many host machine might not have SQL Server installed, therefore, this is the lite version that
works with the .json file.

As for the database limitation the search functionality does not work, therefore it's been left disabled.

To Run:

Extract all the Content in the same root directory. (Android Repo.jar and repo.json)
Make sure, java (version 8) is installed on the host machine, if not then please install java from 
this link:

Just double click on the Android Repo.jar, it should start.
